# Photo Gallery App

Project built for the Ionic/Cordova course as part of the Webforce3 certification program.

## What do we have to do?

With the help of the instructions found here <https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/your-first-app> and using the Angular framework, build an Ionic app that allows taking and managing pictures from a mobile device.

In the end, we are going to export this project as a "native" Android app.

The progress so far:
